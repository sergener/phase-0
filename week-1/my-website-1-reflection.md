To create a repository, you go to your github page. On the top right corner of the page there is a "+" button. When clicked, there is an option to make a new repository.

When your new repo is made, you can copy the HTTPS link. In the correct part of your terminal, you can then clone this. I put my clone into a folder titled DBC, for example. In the terminal type the command git clone [copied link]. The new repo is now cloned onto you computer.

Open source means that software is alowed to be freely used, modified and shared. Private companies won't make their products open source to make sure they have full control of what it's used for. Open source allows programs or websites to become a community building project, allowing people to use the code for other reasons but also making it possible for a wide range of people to edit and make better the master code.

Software licenses dictate how much of the software code is openly available and the ways it can be used. The original developer holds the copyright for the work and will be listed as the original author, but their choice of license grants certain permissions for others to use that work without having to first ask permission.

I messed up challenge 1.6 three times before I got it right, so this entire challenge felt like a relief when everything went exactly as it was supposed to. I do think a lot of the concepts clicked between the challenges because of that.
