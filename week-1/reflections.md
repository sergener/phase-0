To create a new repository on GitHub you should open to your GitHub page and go to the upper right to click on the “+” symbol. In the table that drops down, click “new repository”.

 

In the page that opens, you have a few options in how to create this new repository. You should name it something short and informative. I named mine /phase-0. Because I wanted it to be publicly viewable, I made it public, though it can also be made private.

 

Licensing choice is based on what you plan to code.

 

To then clone the repository to your computer, click on the repository in GitHub. There will be a clone URL available in HTTPS that you can copy.

 

Open the terminal on your computer and make sure you are in the correct directory that you want to put the clone in. Use the command

> git clone [URL you copied]

to clone it to your computer. If you haven’t recently entered your username and password, you may be prompted to do so.

 

To fork a repository another user has made that you’d like a copy of, you go to their repository and click “Fork” on the top right part of the page. You’ll be prompted to decide where the repository should fork to. Once you choose, you will be redirected to the copy of the repository, which you can identify as yours because it has your username in front of the repository name. You can then clone this repository to your computer.

 

Forking repositories is important because it allows you to have a copy of the code that you can play around with without affecting the original user’s code. Since you can use this repo independently, you can do what you want without having to commit back to or change the original code. If you want to, it is possible to sync, but it also allows different users to take a base code and use it for different things.

 

Overall I found the process of creating a repo, cloning, and forking on GitHub pretty straightforward, though I want to practice more to find areas that may give me problems in the future. It’s once I get to the command line that I have some difficulty manipulating repos, so I have to go back and practice more there.
