- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

I find HTML fairly straightforward, so it was fun to put it into action! I did have the initial issue of wondering if I was doing things correctly, but it was really helpful to work with someone and be able to see that we had the same idea of how things worked to confirm I understand HTML correctly.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
The new HTML 5 elements are really interesting, though I'm still not entire sure how they function in comparison to each other. I've been doing some additional reading and hopefully will more fully understand them by the end of the week. Overall though, I'm finding the different elements of HTML to be mostly self-explanatory, which helps me remember them. The structure of writing it with indentations is also very similar to note taking, so it was easy to adapt to.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I haven't used HTML extensively in the past so I didn't have much desire to use any formatting. It's definitely helpful that I haven't done much HTML formatting before, so I'm not really aware of what I'm missing.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

It's very easy to use HTML to make a structure for a webpage. I think it was referenced in a few of the articles, but the way HTML works is very much like making the bones of something, or a foundation. It's a sketch to then use other languages with a larger vocabulary to build on. So it's good because it's simple and fairly easy to understand, with a structure more intutive than other programming languages. However, once it's used more extensively, with formatting or to build more complicated systems, it seems like it would easily become too busy and difficult to understand because of how much is going on. Because of it's tag library, smaller than other languages, it would be cluttered and not efficient to do this.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
For practice, I've written out some HTML in a notebook, which is when it really struck me how similar it is to taking notes in any class situation. There's  the main part of it, and each indentation in is a further subsection of that initial idea.
