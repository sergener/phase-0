What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

- The first phase of web design is information gathering. During this phase the designer should consider what the purpose of the site it and what the site aims to accomplish. The target audience will also influence the design. Finally the designer should keep track of what content will need to be included in the site.
-The second phase is planning. Using the information gathered, the designer will make a site map that plans the major topics and subtopics the site will have.
-The third phase is design. Using the site map and gathered information as a guide, the designer will make a prototype that will display the information in an accessible way that takes into consideration the target audience and goals.
-The fourth stage is development. This is when the site is created, normally starting with the home page and further shells of interior pages. It requires an understanding of HTML and CSS code to create.
-The fifth phase is testing and delivery. The designer fine tunes the website, making sure everything is functional and testing for compatibilty across browsers.
-The final phase is maintenance. Content must be updated to remain relevant, and elements can be changed or added over time.

The site I'm creating in this course will be a professional personal website that shows what I have learned as a developer via a resume, blog posts, and hopefully a page with projects in the future. It will also include an "about" section as well as contact information.

The main index will land on a small blurb about me, with an easy to navigate bar that includes links to the pages that include the resume, blog posts, projects, about, and contact, as well as social media links such as LinkedIn and GitHub. These can then be the various "actions" they can easily take, despending on what they went to my website to do.

It will be important in the design portion to make a website that reflects on my own design abilities; people who will be visiting this page will be interested in me as a developer, and the site itself may be their first impression of my coding skills.

Design and user interface are important to understand, as a user's experience with a website hinges on these components. User interface designers study how users interact with a system. They'll look at the ease of use, utitity, efficiency and more. They also look at the systems, such as a checkout process, that the user will have to interact with and consider the unconscious ways people will react to them.
