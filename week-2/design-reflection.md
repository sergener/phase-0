What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

- The first phase of web design is information gathering. During this phase the designer should consider what the purpose of the site it and what the site aims to accomplish. The target audience will also influence the design. Finally the designer should keep track of what content will need to be included in the site.
-The second phase is planning. Using the information gathered, the designer will make a site map that plans the major topics and subtopics the site will have.
-The third phase is design. Using the site map and gathered information as a guide, the designer will make a prototype that will display the information in an accessible way that takes into consideration the target audience and goals.
-The fourth stage is development. This is when the site is created, normally starting with the home page and further shells of interior pages. It requires an understanding of HTML and CSS code to create.
-The fifth phase is testing and delivery. The designer fine tunes the website, making sure everything is functional and testing for compatibilty across browsers.
-The final phase is maintenance. Content must be updated to remain relevant, and elements can be changed or added over time.

The site I'm creating in this course will be a professional personal website that shows what I have learned as a developer via a resume, blog posts, and hopefully a page with projects in the future. It will also include a picture and information about me.

What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
