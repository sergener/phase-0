A wireframe is a visual setup of a website that puts each element in place. It's essentially a blueprint of what a website will looklike, and allows a designer to get an idea of the layout of a page, how the user will interact with the interface, and what elements can be included on a page. It's essential to the design process because it provides a sense of what elements will go where; the HTML framework that comes next would be much more difficult without an idea of what needs to be included in what order. It's also beneficial as the sketch for CSS so designers will make less initial mistakes.

I really enjoyed wireframing. It was good to get a sense of what I wanted on a page versus what I could fit on while it still looked good. While making the index it's easy to think you can get everything in a certain way, but wireframing allowed me to break it up visually and decide what might need to be changed or pushed somewhere else. I did revise my initial idea and edit it over a few days, especially after doing more of the HTML framework and getting a better idea of what I'm capable of right now. I did keep some of my original ideas, though, with the idea that in the future I can work towards making them a reality.

Coming from a visual arts background, I'd always found web design intimidating but now I wish I'd taken more design classes as I've found wireframing to be a fun process overall. A slightly challenging and tedious area was just not knowing exactly what I'll be able to pull off at this stage of what we'll learn in HTML and CSS, but I'm looking forward to figuring it out.
