/*
As a user, I want to give you a group of whole numbers to do three different math problems with.
The problems should work whether I give you an even or odd amount of numbers to work with.

1. Sum: The program should be able to take those numbers and add them up.
2. Mean: The program should also be able to take the numbers and come up with an average.
3. Median: The program should be able to give a median value of all the numbers.
