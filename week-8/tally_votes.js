// Pseudocode
//Tests 1-4
//Input: Object votes that holds information
//Output: Tally of votes a person got for each different office
//Steps:
//Create a function voteCount
//voteCount will iterate through the objects, targeting specific values within the objects (president, vice president, secretary, treasurer) and count the amount of times they appear per person
//To count:
//have a counter variable that starts at 0
//for each time the person's name appears, add +1 to counter
//return that number
//to test: 

//Tests 5-8
//Input: Object votes with key, values, etc.
//Output: Object(variable) with final slate of officer's names
//Steps:
//Create a function officers
//officers is in object that contains properties and associated values
//Using final tallies from var voteCount, push associated name into proper 
//value position
