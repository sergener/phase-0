-	How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

Chrome DevTools is very helpful to see what changes you're making live. It also allows you to immediately see if the source code you're using is correct. It's also very helpful as a beginner because I was able to see if what I was doing worked and could keep trying until the element did what I wanted to without worrying that I would mess up my code.

-	How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

Changing the width and height using px, em, or % will resize the element.

- What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

We struggled with absolute because the other reformatting we did didnâ€™t necessarily show up. Some research near the end revealed that absolute elements can only be moved if the parent element is absolute or relative. Otherwise it will be positioned in relation to html.

Fixed was very straightforward. It is positioned relative to the browser window and not scroll with the other elements.

Static is the default positioning for an element. The only reason to apply it is if source-code gets applied to an element outside of your control and you have to override it.

Relative positioning positions and element in relation to itself. bottom: 20px will move the element 20px from where it would normally be. It will also position on top of static elements unless you use z index to change where it floats.

-	What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?

The margin is the space around the element. The larger the margin, the more space between the element and the elements around it.

The border surrounds the element and if it is, for example, 2px it will add those 2px on each side to the entire size of the element.

Padding is the spacing between the content and the border. If the element has a bckground color, the padding will also have that background color.

-	What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

It was useful as a pairing challenge because we could take turns researching and work in a team to defuse some of the frustration. CSS can be very frustrating and having someone to take over and make suggestions when you feel like you hit a mental block makes everythign run more smoothly.
