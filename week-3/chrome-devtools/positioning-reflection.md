•	How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

•	How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

Changing the width and height using px, em, or % will resize the element.

What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

We struggled with asolute because the other reformatting we did didn’t necessarily show up.

Fixed was very straightforward, as the element stayed where we asked it to go.

•	What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
The margin is the space around the element. The larger the margin, the more space between the element and the elements around it.

The border surrounds the element and if it is, for example, 2px it will add those 2px on each side to the entire size of the element.

Padding is the spacing between the content and the border. If the element has a bckground color, the padding will also have that background color.

•	What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
It was useful as a pairing challenge because we could take turns researching and work in a team to defuse some of the frustration. CSS can be very frustrating and having someone to take over and make suggestions when you feel like you hit a mental block makes everythign run more smoothly.
