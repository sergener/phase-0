 <h1>GPS 1.2: The Anatomy of HTML</h1>
 <section>
 	<h2>Summary</h2>
 	<p>
 	Welcome to HTML Anatomy 101. In this class, you will do the
learn how to dissect an HTML page from the &lt;head&gt; to the &lt;footer&gt;, add a new feature to Sublime Text, and mark up your previous blog posts with semantic HTML tags. So get your gloves on, open your textbook (the HTML docs (Links to an external site.)) and begin!
 	</p>
 </section>
 <section>
 	<h2>Release 0: Set up</h2>
 	<p>Decide who will drive and who will navigate. Then each of you will need to:</p>
 	<ul>
 	<li>Create a feature branch in the phase-0 directory</li>
 	<li>Using the command line, navigate to the week-3 directory</li>
 	<li>Within that directory, (using the command line) create a blank HTML page called dissect-me.html.</li>
 	<li>Add, commit, and push your changes to GitHub. Create a quick pull request and merge the changes.</li>
 	<li>SUBMIT your link to the dissect-me.html file as soon as you do this. This is how your guide will give you feedback. The URL should be something like: https://github.com/[USERNAME]/phase-0/blob/master/week-3/dissect-me.html (Links to an external site.)</li>
 	</ul>
 	<p>
 	NOTE: You should decide whether to trade roles in each release or change roles halfway through the session. If you decide to switch from release to release, you'll want to share code easily using a collaborative editor (or even a simple Google doc).

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

All of the HTML5 tags we used are very useful in creating a simple and effective HTML skeleton.
Header and footer were great for designing more fixed elements that will carry over between webpages.
Section in particular is useful for breaking up areas of different text.
It's useful that HTML5 gives common uses of elements each their own name, which makes them
easier to target in CSS later on.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

The browser renders elements in a tree, with elements branching out from parents elements while the root/trunk is the html tag.
The coordinates where the elements land, if not modified in HTML, CSS, or other ways is in the order that they are read,
with parent elements leading to their child elements.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I didn't know about snippets and I'm very interested in learning more about what Sublime can do.
I will definitely do more research on what snippets are already available and I can see that as 
I continue to do more specific kinds of coding that being able to create more personalized shorcuts
will make life easier.
