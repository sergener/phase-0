 	<h2>Summary</h2>
 	<p>
 	Welcome to HTML Anatomy 101. In this class, you will do the
learn how to dissect an HTML page from the &lt;head&gt; to the &lt;footer&gt;, add a new feature to Sublime Text, and mark up your previous blog posts with semantic HTML tags. So get your gloves on, open your textbook (the HTML docs (Links to an external site.)) and begin!

 	<h2>Release 0: Set up</h2>
 	<p>Decide who will drive and who will navigate. Then each of you will need to:</p>
 	<ul>
 	<li>Create a feature branch in the phase-0 directory</li>
 	<li>Using the command line, navigate to the week-3 directory</li>
 	<li>Within that directory, (using the command line) create a blank HTML page called dissect-me.html.</li>
 	<li>Add, commit, and push your changes to GitHub. Create a quick pull request and merge the changes.</li>
 	<li>SUBMIT your link to the dissect-me.html file as soon as you do this. This is how your guide will give you feedback. The URL should be something like: https://github.com/[USERNAME]/phase-0/blob/master/week-3/dissect-me.html (Links to an external site.)</li>
 	</ul>
 	<p>
 	NOTE: You should decide whether to trade roles in each release or change roles halfway through the session. If you decide to switch from release to release, you'll want to share code easily using a collaborative editor (or even a simple Google doc).
